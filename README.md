# Farm Wallet

A simple, user-friendly single-token wallet for eCash (XEC) built with React and Vite. This wallet is designed to handle one specific token at a time, making it perfect for projects that need a focused, streamlined wallet experience.

## Features

- 🪙 **Single-token focus** - Configure for one specific token
- 🌍 **Multi-language support** - Built-in internationalization

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zh/farm-wallet.git
cd farm-wallet
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Token
Copy the environment example file and set your token ID:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your token ID:

```bash
VITE_TOKEN_ID=your_token_id_here
```

### 3. Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your wallet will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Environment Configuration

### Setting VITE_TOKEN_ID

The `VITE_TOKEN_ID` is the most important configuration. This determines which token your wallet will handle.

1. **Find your token ID**: This is a long string (usually 64 characters) that uniquely identifies your token on the eCash network
2. **Add it to .env**: Replace `your_token_id_here` with your actual token ID
3. **Restart the dev server**: Environment changes require a restart

Example:

```bash
VITE_TOKEN_ID=4bd147fc5d5ff26249a9299c46b80920c0b81f59a60895a2ca91a5a6fb9d8da1
```

### Other Configuration Options

You can add other environment variables to customize the wallet:

```bash
# Optional: Custom API endpoints
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.com

# Optional: Network configuration  
VITE_NETWORK=mainnet
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run linting

## Customizing the Wallet
